    "This is a classic problem in probability theory known as the \"100 prisoners problem\" or the \"Monty Hall problem with multiple doors\". The probability that the last passenger gets to sit in his or her assigned seat is 1/2 or 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see why, consider the following two cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Case 1: The first passenger sits in his or her assigned seat. In this case, all subsequent passengers will also sit in their assigned seats, and the last passenger will get to sit in his or her assigned seat with probability 1.\n",

    "Case 2: The first passenger sits in a seat other than his or her assigned seat. In this case, there are two possibilities for what happens next:\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario 2a: The second passenger sits in his or her assigned seat (which is the seat that the first passenger chose). In this case, all subsequent passengers will also sit in their assigned seats, and the last passenger will get to sit in his or her assigned seat with probability 1/2 (since there are two seats left, one of which is his or her assigned seat).\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario 2b: The second passenger sits in a seat other than his or her assigned seat (which is the seat that the first passenger did not choose). In this case, the third passenger has two possible seats to choose from: his or her assigned seat (which is still available) or the seat that the first passenger chose (which is now taken by the second passenger). If the third passenger chooses his or her assigned seat, all subsequent passengers will also sit in their assigned seats, and the last passenger will get to sit in his or her assigned seat with probability 1/2 (since there are two seats left, one of which is his or her assigned seat). If the third passenger chooses the seat that the first passenger chose, the fourth passenger has two possible seats to choose from: his or her assigned seat (which is still available) or the seat that the first passenger did not choose (which is now taken by the second passenger). This process continues until either a passenger chooses his or her assigned seat (in which case all subsequent passengers will also sit in their assigned seats and the last passenger will get to sit in his or her assigned seat with probability 1/2) or the last passenger has only one seat to choose from (which is his or her assigned seat).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, since the first passenger chooses a seat randomly, the probability of Case 1 is 1/100, and the probability of Case 2 is 99/100. Moreover, the probability of Scenario 2a is 1/2, and the probability of Scenario 2b is also 1/2. Therefore, the probability that the last passenger gets to sit in his or her assigned seat is:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1/100) * 1 + (99/100) * (1/2 * 1/2 + 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 + 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 + ...) = 1/2\n",
    "\n",
    "The second term in the equation represents the probability of Case 2, and the sum represents the probability of all possible scenarios in Case 2 (i.e., the probability of Scenario 2a plus the probability of all possible sequences of Scenarios 2b). The sum converges to 1/2, so the probability that the last passenger gets to sit in his or her assigned seat is 1/2 or 0.5."
