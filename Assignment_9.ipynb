For example, if they lose the first game, they may become more cautious in the second game, while if they win the first game, they may become more aggressive. Assuming that the outcomes are conditionally independent given the opponent's skill level means that the outcome of one game may affect the outcome of the other game, but only through the opponent's playing ability.
